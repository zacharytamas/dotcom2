## Computers

My primary desktop machine where I do most of my work is an iMac Pro. Aside obviously the price, I've had no issues with the machine and I really enjoy it. It is overpowered for most of my common work but I really enjoy never worrying about performance. I've never heard the fans speed up on it once even while doing heavy compilation while watching video on an external 4K monitor.

For that external monitor I currently have a [Dell 27" 4K display (U2718Q)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073VYVX5S/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) connected via Type-C to Mini DisplayPort. I like the display well enough but I've never been able to get the colors to match the iMac's built-in display. I run the external display at a slightly higher resolution than the iMac's display and mostly use it for reference materials. I find the iMac's screen much nicer for reading code on.

When away from my desk but needing to work, I use a 15" 2016 MacBook Pro. I had keyboard problems early on as did most people and had it and basically everything else replaced in early 2018. They installed a 2017 model of the keyboard when they fixed it.

## Mobile devices

I use an iPhone X. I've bounced back and forth between iPhones and Nexus/Pixel for years but I've finally settled on the iPhone X and don't currently see any real need to upgrade when the 2018 iPhones are announced. I intentionally use my phone for so little these days there's not a whole lot of new features that could really be _that_ valuable to me.

## Apps

### macOS

#### Development

My code editor of choice is VS Code with a light theme (usually) and `Dank Mono` for my coding font. I like `Dank Mono` and its cursive and ligatures but I wish it had more weights than just the one. I use iTerm for my terminal.

### iOS
