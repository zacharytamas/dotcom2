This is the [Gatsy.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) source of my website at [zacharytamas.com](https://zacharytamas.com). I forked it originally from the [`gatsby-starter-lumen`](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen) package but have been tweaking it while learning Gatsby. I expect it'll eventually diverge completely but it's nice to learn and tweak while having a website that doesn't look horrible in the meantime.

The website is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) as my first experiment with using them. So far, two days in, I think they're really handy.
